#Localization of Partial Discharges in Transformers

#Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a software application designed to localize partial discharges within transformers. The application utilizes advanced algorithms and matrix calculations to determine the spatial coordinates of partial discharges based on input data.

#Features
- Calculation of partial discharge distances: The application calculates the distances between the partial discharge points and the corresponding sensors based on user-provided parameters.
- Matrix-based localization method: A matrix approach is employed to determine the spatial coordinates of the partial discharges within the transformer.
- Alternative measurement positions: The application proposes alternative measurement positions to reduce errors and optimize the accuracy of the localization.
- Validation and verification: The application validates the localization results by comparing the calculated positions with the generated positions.
- Improved accuracy: The application demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy of partial discharge localization when using the proposed measurement points.
#Getting Started
